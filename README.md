# MTACompliance_Website

This website will be develop for MTAC Trucking Compliance, a truck insurance agency. I will be used for clients to email about questions, concerns, etc, and many more features. The website will be developed using the following languages: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, and
a JS library; the latter would be either Vue.Js or Jquery for providing client-friendly interaction with the website, and small animations.
