                M-Tac Trucking Compliance LLC was established on January 1st of
                2019.
                <br /><br />
                I found that many carriers are in need of a point of contact for
                assistance in becoming and remaining in compliance with 49 CFR
                (The USDOT regulations governing commercial vehicle compliance).
                I will ensure you and your drivers are in compliance with all
                Federal and State regulations.
                <br /><br />
                I have the knowledge necessary to review roadside inspections
                and advise on incorrectly documented violations, which is
                essential when challenging inspections to improve your CSA
                Safety Rating. I perform post-crash inspections and properly
                document my findings for future purposes, such as insurance
                claims.
                <br /><br />
                Proper training is essential for all aspects of transportation
                safety, including driver safety, hours of service requirements,
                and performance or maintenance issues. Using a contemporary and
                aggressive approach, I will work alongside you and your company
                to ensure a thorough understanding of industry standards and
                that you and your employees have the tools necessary for the
                safe and compliant operation of your business.
